    <h2 class="h4">What is Clask?</h2>
    <p>
      Clask is a lazy-student-friendly app that connects to your Gmail, finds academic emails like assignment deadlines, test announcements, or lab details, and automatically adds them to your calendar.
    </p>


    <h2 class="h4 mt-4">Why I Built This</h2>
    <p>
      I kept missing important emails because I didnâ€™t want to scroll through tons of notifications. Clask helps by using AI to find the useful parts in emails from professors and creates events from them. No manual work needed.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h4 mt-4">How It Works</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>You connect your Gmail account</li>
      <li>You add the email addresses you want Clask to track (like your professors)</li>
      <li>Clask watches your inbox in the background</li>
      <li>If it finds an important message, it uses AI to pull out the details and add them to your calendar</li>
    </ol>
